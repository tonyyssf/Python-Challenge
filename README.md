PyBank Instructions

In this Challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. I was given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

In addition, my final script printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results.

PyPoll Instructions

In this Challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.

I was given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:

- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote

In addition, my final script printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a text file with the results.
